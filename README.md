# ðŸ©º Heart Disease Prediction using KNN

This project builds a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model to predict heart disease based on patient health indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset includes medical features like blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and more, with a binary target: HeartDisease (0 or 1).

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Project Workflow
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- One-Hot Encoding of Categorical Features
- Feature Scaling
- KNN Model Building
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation

## Key Results
- Best model achieved an accuracy of **`xx%`** with `k = X`
- Used confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate precision and recall

## What I Learned
- End-to-end ML pipeline from raw data to tuned model
- Importance of scaling for KNN
- Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation techniques
